To be an even number, it must end in 0 or 2. To be a multiple of 3, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3.\\n\\n## Step 3: Try out different combinations of digits\\nGiven that the number must be even, we start by trying the combinations that end in 0 or 2. We can then check if the sum of these digits is a multiple of 3.\\n\\n## Step 4: Check for the smallest possible number\\nStart with the smallest possible combination for the first digit, which is 0. However, it would result in 0 itself, which is not a positive multiple of 30.\\n\\n## Step 5: Identify a possible multiple\\nTrying 20, we find that 200 is not a multiple of 3 because 2+0+0 = 2, which is not a multiple of 3.\\n\\n## Step 6: Try a larger combination\\nLet's try using the next possible combination of digits, which is 2 for the first digit.\\n\\n## Step 7: Check the sum for divisibility by 3\\nUsing 220, 2+2+0 = 4, which is not a multiple of 3.\\n\\n## Step 8: Continue checking combinations\\nNext, using the combination 2 for the units place, we get 220. 2+2+0 = 4, which is still not a multiple of 3.\\n\\n## Step 9: Continue checking combinations\\nUsing the combination 2 for the hundreds place, we get 220. 2+2+0 = 4, which is not a multiple of 3.\\n\\n## Step 10: Check the tens digit\\nLet's try using 0 for the tens place. We have 20 and 220. 2+0+0 = 2, which is not a multiple of 3.\\n\\n## Step 11: End with the correct combination\\nUsing 0 for the hundreds and tens place results in the number 220. However, 220 is not the correct answer because we are told the number can use only 0 and 2. Thus, we need to try a different combination.\\n\\n## Step 12: Analyze the next possible combination\\nWe need to examine the combination that ends in 20.\\n\\n## Step 13: Check for the sum of digits being a multiple of 3\\nFor the combination 202, 2+0+2 = 4, which is not a multiple of 3.\\n\\n## Step 14: Continue checking combinations\\nUsing the combination 202, 2+0+2 = 4, which is not a multiple of 3.\\n\\n## Step 15: Analyze another combination\\nUsing the last possible combination for the hundreds place is not valid since we need the number to be greater than 20.\\n\\n## Step 16: Analyze the next valid combination\\nThe next valid combination would be the thousands place.\\n\\n## Step 17: Find the first valid combination.\\nSince we need a multiple of 30, we need to try different combinations of digits.\\n\\n## Step 18: Start with a different combination\\nConsider starting with the smallest possible hundreds digit, which is 2.\\n\\n## Step 19: Analyze combinations\\nWe have 202, 220, 2202. However, these are not a valid combination because they do not consist only of the digits 0 and 2.\\n\\n## Step 20: Continue trying\\nLet's try using 2 as the first digit, but using 202, 220 are the only possible options, and neither of these is valid since we can't have a number with a 2 as the first digit and not 0.\\n\\n## Step 21: Try the next combination.\\nWe need to try a lower number.\\n\\n## Step 22: Find a valid option\\nLet's look for a combination that starts with a 2 and ends in 20. The valid options would be 2200, 2202, 2200, and 2202. However, these contain the digit 2, so they are not valid.\\n\\n## Step 23: Identify the correct solution\\nSince 2200 is a valid valid option. But, upon checking again and going to the lower option that starts with 0, 2020 is the correct number.\\n\\n## Step 24: Use this number.\\nThe least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2 is 2020.\\n\\nThe final answer is: $\\\\boxed{2020}$\",\n",
